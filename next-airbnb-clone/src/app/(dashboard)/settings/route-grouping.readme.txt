# Route Grouping 

Route grouping allows us to group together mutiple pages where you'd like the layout combined, or other properties. 

To create a route group we create a directory with parenthesis, which will then bypass the `Next.js` routing system. 

The subsequent folders under this grouped directory function exactly as you'd expect from the rest of the application, in 
terms of url routing.
