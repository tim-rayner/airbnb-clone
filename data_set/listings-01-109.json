For the past 20 years Elisa has been a yoga instructor, teaching private and group classes mainly in Kensington and Notting Hill. Dominic is a professional sailor who also does renovation work when not at sea. Together have 5 children aged between 25 and 33 - who have all now flown the nest.\n\nWe enjoy people, sunshine, sailing and family. We run yoga and sailing holidays around the world including regular retreats in Kerala in India, UK, Turkey, Italy, Greece and Spain.\nWe have been hosting guests in the spare bedroom in our home since 2010 and it has proved to be a really enjoyable experience. \n\nWe have enjoyed meeting so many people from all over the world and getting to know them a little during their stays with us. \n\nWe have ourselves been guests in a number of Airbnb home rentals  in Iceland, Wales, France and Spain. \n\nThere is something rather special about staying in a less touristy location and experiencing a place with the personal touch of staying in a home with local people as their guests rather than a generic hotel room. However we also understand the importance of retaining that sense of privacy we all appreciate.\n\nFor many years we used to swap homes with other families in Europe & the US. We enjoyed the mutual respect between ourselves and our exchange partners to be respectful of each other's property.  When in the summer of 2012 London hosted the Olympics, Airbnb encouraged their â€˜spare roomâ€™ hosts to rent out their whole home to visitors coming to the city.  It wasnâ€™t uncharted territory for us to trust strangers to look after our home so we decided to give it a try.  \n\nEven with the financial exchange involved, we have enjoyed a trusting relationships with our guests. They understand that this is our family home and not an impersonal investment rental property.  Itâ€™s been great to hear their feedback as to how much they have enjoyed living in our diverse London neighbourhood and weâ€™ve truly appreciated the pride consecutive guests have taken in looking after our home. \n\nThis positive experience encourages us to continue to rent our home as part of a lifestyle shift that we have embarked upon in recent years.  \n\nWe have regularly house/pet sat for friends, neighbours and extended family. Now when our home is rented we take on short, medium and long term housesits in the UK and Europe.

Like most kiwis I love to travel and enjoy nothing better than seeing new corners of the world and meeting new people. I also love my time at home though and have created a modern and comfortable space that reflects my interest in mid-century design and art. I love to cook and often have friends over for dinner.

It is located in the London Borough of Camden, in zone two of the London Underground. It borders Belsize Park/Finchley Road to the east, and Kilburn/Willesden to the west. In the north are Cricklewood and Golders Green, whilst to the south lie uber-refined St. John's Wood and Maida Vale. The area is home to three train stations (all, confusingly, called West Hampstead!) and is a bona fide yuppie stronghold.<br />Though West Hampstead is hardly a place that springs to mind when you think nightlife, it has a smattering of good restaurants, pubs and bars. On the whole, the area's watering holes are towards the swankier (and pricier) end of the spectrum, and places tend to feel more mature feel than, say, Camden Town.<br /><br />In terms of nightclubs, Lately on West End Lane is a charming old-school dancing spot, whilst the Lower Ground Bar (also on West End Lane) flaunts its status as \"West Hampstead's Premi","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/ec999674-6b16-4281-931e-8a3378c30a8e.jpg","host_id":199530,"host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/199530","host_name":"Deb","host_since":"12/08/2010","host_location":"London, United Kingdom","host_about":"Love travelling and meet people.

Life to me is a storybook full of fascinating tales. I amass information 'on the hoof' and very little passes me by. Understanding what makes others tick is meat and drink to me and proves to be a source of endless joy.\n\nI always keep my mind active. I love beauty in all forms, I am well-educated, and I like to remain totally classless. This makes it easy for me to get on with just about any sort of person. I am thought-provoking and even quite deep on occasions. I also get involved in other exciting things which keep me busy too, such as painting, reading books, newspaper and cultural magazines, photography, video editing, cycling, theatre, music, and movies.\n\nFurthermore, I strongly believe a very clean, secure, welcoming feel, and comfortable apartment is of paramount importance for travellers.\n\nMy life's golden rule is to treat others as you wish to be treated!\n\nI am always on an adventure. Enjoy hearing about people's travels and lifestyles.\n\nYou may want to know that I am a very responsive host, so if you encounter any issues while staying in my properties, I very much appreciate you to address them straight away and give me the chance to fix them.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAdriano","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"97%","host_is_superhost":"t","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-43039/original/853cc53b-300f-4b04-8dd1-1e065c29a760.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-43039/original/853cc53b-300f-4b04-8dd1-1e065c29a760.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Brixton","host_listings_count":2,"host_total_listings_count":14,"host_verifications":"['email', 'phone']","host_has_profile_pic":"t","host_identity_verified":"t","neighbourhood":"London, United Kingdom","neighbourhood_cleansed":"Lambeth","neighbourhood_group_cleansed":"","latitude":51.46201,"longitude":-0.117145,"property_type":"Entire rental unit","room_type":"Entire home/apt","accommodates":5,"bathrooms":1,"bathrooms_text":"1 bath","bedrooms":1,"beds":3,"amenities":"[\"Toaster\", \"40\\\" HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, DVD player\", \"Shampoo\", \"Fast wifi \\u2013 177 Mbps\", \"Cleaning products\", \"Fire extinguisher\", \"Heating\", \"Self check-in\", \"Bathtub\", \"Courtyard view\", \"Body soap\", \"Free street parking\", \"Bed linens\", \"Microwave\", \"Lockbox\", \"Essentials\", \"Paid street parking off premises\", \"Coffee maker\", \"Iron\", \"Refrigerator\", \"Hangers\", \"Carbon monoxide alarm\", \"Pets allowed\", \"Portable air conditioning\", \"Smoke alarm\", \"First aid kit\", \"Cooking basics\", \"Hair dryer\", \"Oven\", \"Free washer \\u2013 In unit\"]","price":"$114.00","minimum_nights":1,"maximum_nights":1125,"minimum_minimum_nights":1,"maximum_minimum_nights":3,"minimum_maximum_nights":1,"maximum_maximum_nights":1125,"minimum_nights_avg_ntm":1.2,"maximum_nights_avg_ntm":514.8,"calendar_updated":"","has_availability":"t","availability_30":7,"availability_60":24,"availability_90":40,"availability_365":207,"calendar_last_scraped":"20/03/2024","number_of_reviews":50,"number_of_reviews_ltm":3,"number_of_reviews_l30d":0,"first_review":"19/05/2012","last_review":"13/10/2023","review_scores_rating":4.79,"review_scores_accuracy":4.88,"review_scores_cleanliness":4.86,"review_scores_checkin":4.75,"review_scores_communication":4.84,"review_scores_location":4.73,"review_scores_value":4.5,"license":"","instant_bookable":"f","calculated_host_listings_count":2,"calculated_host_listings_count_entire_homes":2,"calculated_host_listings_count_private_rooms":0,"calculated_host_listings_count_shared_rooms":0,"reviews_per_month":0.35},{"id":63948,"listing_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/63948","scrape_id":20240300000000,"last_scraped":"21/03/2024","source":"city scrape","name":"Cosy Double studio in Zone 2 Hammersmith (4)","description":"","neighborhood_overview":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-63948/original/c930ded2-519e-46a5-83f3-22463af82ac2.jpeg","host_id":216660,"host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/216660","host_name":"Boris","host_since":"29/08/2010","host_location":"London, United Kingdom","host_about":"I have several studios and apartments in London  Hammersmith.
